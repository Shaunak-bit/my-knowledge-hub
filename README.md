### description
My Knowledge Hub is a full-stack personal knowledge management application built with modern web technologies. The frontend leverages React 19, TypeScript, Vite, and TailwindCSS 4 to provide a responsive user interface with features such as user authentication (login/register), a personal dashboard for managing knowledge, bookmark management, note creation and organization, tag-based categorization, and protected routes secured by an authentication context. The backend, developed with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, supports secure user management with JWT authentication and offers RESTful API endpoints for authentication, bookmark CRUD operations, notes management, and tag organization. Key features include flexible content organization through bookmarks and notes, a custom tagging system for categorization, and real-time updates to synchronize data efficiently. The project structure consists of a frontend folder using React and Vite, a backend folder with Express and MongoDB, additional server files, and shared configurations. The backend currently runs on port 5000, serving the frontend application. This platform is designed to help users save, organize, and retrieve their learning resources effectively.
